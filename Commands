Inspect history
git log [-n count] List commit history of current branch. -n count limits list to last
n commits.
git log --oneline
--graph --decorate
An overview with reference labels and history graph. One
commit per line.
git log ref . List commits that are present on the current branch and not
merged into ref. A ref can be a branch name or a tag name.
git log .ref List commit that are present on ref and not merged into current
branch.
git reflog List operations (e.g. checkouts or commits) made on local
repository.
git fetch [remote] Fetch changes from the remote, but not update tracking
branches.
git fetch --prune
[remote]
Delete remote Refs that were removed from the remote
repository.
git pull [remote] Fetch changes from the remote and merge current branch with
its upstream.
git push [--tags]
[remote] Push local changes to the remote. Use --tags to push tags.
git push -u [remote]
[branch]
Push local branch to remote repository. Set its copy as an
upstream
git tag List all tags.
git tag [name]
[commit sha]
Create a tag reference named name for current commit. Add
commit sha to tag a specific commit instead of current one.
git tag -a [name]
[commit sha] Create a tag object named name for current commit.
git tag -d [name] Remove a tag from local repository.
8 Reverting changes
git reset [--hard]
[target reference]
Switches the current branch to the target reference, leaving
a difference as an uncommitted change. When --hard is used,
all changes are discarded. It's easy to lose uncommitted
changes with --hard.
git revert [commit sha] Create a new commit, reverting changes from the specified
commit. It generates an inversion of changes.
